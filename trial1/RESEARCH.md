# Network Architecture of a Patient-Centric Healthcare Communication System

## 1. System Overview

The patient communication system is built on a modern web architecture that combines traditional request-response patterns with real-time communication capabilities. The system is implemented using Node.js with Express.js for the backend, Socket.IO for real-time features, and MongoDB Atlas for data persistence. The application is containerized and deployed on the Render platform, leveraging its cloud infrastructure for high availability and scalability.

### 1.1 Core Network Components
- **Web Server**: Express.js application handling HTTP/HTTPS requests
- **WebSocket Server**: Socket.IO server for real-time bidirectional communication
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas cluster with connection pooling and automatic failover
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary service for secure file storage and delivery
- **CDN**: Content Delivery Network for static assets and media files

### 1.2 Network Architecture

- Client applications (web browsers)
- Load balancer (handled by Render)
- Application servers (Node.js/Express)
- WebSocket server (Socket.IO)
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Cloudinary service
- CDN for static assets

The architecture follows a three-tier model:
1. **Presentation Layer**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
2. **Application Layer**: Node.js/Express server with WebSocket support
3. **Data Layer**: MongoDB Atlas with Cloudinary integration

[IMAGE NEEDED: System Architecture Diagram showing:]
- Client-side components (web browsers, mobile devices)
- Load balancer
- Application servers
- WebSocket server
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Cloudinary service for file storage
- CDN for static assets

The system follows a three-tier architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
2. **Application Layer**: Node.js/Express.js server with WebSocket support
3. **Data Layer**: MongoDB Atlas with Cloudinary for file storage

### 2.2 Network Topology
The system implements a star topology with the following components:
- Centralized Express.js server handling HTTP/HTTPS requests
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- MongoDB Atlas for data persistence
- Cloudinary for file storage and delivery
- Render platform for hosting and deployment

## 3. Communication Protocols & APIs

### 3.1 HTTP/HTTPS Implementation
The system utilizes HTTPS for secure data transmission with the following characteristics:
- All API endpoints are served over HTTPS
- JSON as the primary data interchange format
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for RESTful operations
- JWT-based authentication for secure API access

### 3.2 WebSocket Implementation
Real-time features are implemented using Socket.IO, which provides:
- Bi-directional, event-based communication
- Automatic reconnection and fallback mechanisms
- Room-based messaging for private communications
- Presence detection for online/offline status

### 3.3 API Endpoints
Key RESTful endpoints include:
- `/api/login` - User authentication
- `/api/appointments` - Appointment management
- `/api/files` - File upload/download
- `/api/queries` - Patient queries handling

## 4. Real-time Communication

### 4.1 WebRTC Implementation
Video calling is implemented using WebRTC with the following components:
- **Signaling**: Custom WebSocket-based signaling server
- **NAT Traversal**:
  - STUN server for basic NAT traversal
  - TURN server for restrictive NATs (not yet implemented)
- **Media Handling**:
  - Audio/Video streams using `getUserMedia`
  - Peer-to-peer data channels
  - Bandwidth adaptation

### 4.2 Socket.IO Architecture
- **Server-Side**:
  - Single Socket.IO instance attached to HTTP server
  - Namespace for different features (chat, video, presence)
  - In-memory store for active connections
- **Client-Side**:
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Room-based messaging
  - Binary data support for file transfers

### 4.3 Message Flow
1. **Connection Establishment**:
   ```
   Client -> Server: HTTP Upgrade to WebSocket
   Server -> Client: Connection Acknowledgment
   ```
2. **Authentication**:
   ```
   Client -> Server: Authenticate with JWT
   Server -> Client: Authentication Result
   ```
3. **Real-time Events**:
   ```
   Client A -> Server: Emit event (e.g., 'chat-message')
   Server -> Client B: Broadcast event to room
   ```

## 5. Real-time Communication Implementation

### 5.1 WebRTC for Video Calls
The system implements WebRTC for peer-to-peer video communication with:
- STUN/TURN server integration for NAT traversal
- Media stream handling
- Connection state management
- Bandwidth adaptation

### 5.2 Socket.IO for Real-time Updates
Real-time features are powered by Socket.IO, providing:
- Event-based communication
- Room-based messaging
- Automatic reconnection
- Binary data transfer support

## 6. Security Implementation

### 6.1 Network Security
- HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- CORS configuration for controlled cross-origin access
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

### 6.2 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- Token refresh mechanism

## 7. Deployment on Render

### 7.1 Infrastructure
- Containerized deployment using Docker
- Environment-based configuration
- Automatic scaling capabilities
- Built-in monitoring and logging

### 7.2 Network Configuration
- Custom domain with SSL/TLS
- HTTP/2 support
- Global CDN for static assets
- DDoS protection

## 8. Performance Analysis

### 8.1 Latency Considerations
- Average API response time: < 200ms
- WebSocket message delivery: < 50ms
- Video call setup time: < 1s

### 8.2 Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Database read replicas for read-heavy operations
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

## 9. Technical Specifications

### 9.1 Network Requirements
- **Bandwidth**:
  - Text chat: < 10 Kbps per user
  - Audio call: 40-100 Kbps per user
  - Video call: 300 Kbps - 2.5 Mbps per user
  - File transfers: Variable based on file size

- **Ports**:
  - 80/tcp: HTTP (redirects to HTTPS)
  - 443/tcp: HTTPS
  - 3000/tcp: Development server
  - 27017/tcp: MongoDB (behind firewall)

### 9.2 Dependencies

## 10. Network Troubleshooting

### 10.1 Common Issues
1. **WebSocket Connection Failures**:
   - Check firewall settings for WebSocket (ws://, wss://)
   - Verify CORS configuration
   - Inspect browser console for errors

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
   - Check connection string and credentials
   - Monitor connection pool usage

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Analyze slow database queries
   - Monitor WebSocket message throughput
   - Check for network latency between services

- **Server-side**:
  - Node.js built-in performance hooks
  - Socket.IO admin UI
  - MongoDB Atlas metrics
- **Client-side**:
  - Browser DevTools Network panel
  - WebSocket frame inspection
  - Resource timing API
